# DAP05 - Machine Learning: Identify Fraud from Enron Email
## Overview
This project involves using machine learning techniques to identify the People of Interest from the publicly available Enron Dataset. 

This repository contains:

- report.html: html report / notes for project
- explore_enron_data.py: used for the initial data exploration of the Enron data
- plot.py: used to create simple scatterplots for exploring the data
- assets: folder with images for report
- tools: scripts that were provided by Udacity for downloading the initial data and converting the data for the machine learning tasks
- final_project: this folder contains the scripts and pkl files for the project.

An online version of the report can be viewed [here][report]

## Running the Project
The 2 main scripts for the project are poi_id.py and tester.py, which are located in the final_project folder

- poi_id.py was used to prepare the classifer algorithm, tune it and prepare the dataset then dump the results to pkl files
- tester.py is used to test the performance of the classifier algorithm
